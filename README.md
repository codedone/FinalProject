Hey guys!

I just went ahead and created a ReadMe. I also created a directory to test out the Twitter API (just a heads up). I know that I didn't really need to commit the directory, but I figured it's a good way for us to keep up with each other's progress.

Anyway, I hope y'alls work is going well.
